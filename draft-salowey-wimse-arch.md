# Use Cases

1. Basic Serivce Authentication

One of the most basic use cases for workload identity is for authenticating one workload to another such as in the case where one microservice is making a request of another microservice within a larger application. Even in this simple case the identity of the workload is often a composite of many attributes such as:

* Service Name
* Instance Name
* Role
* Environment
* Trust Domain
* Software Attestation
* Hardare Attestation

These attributes are used for various purposes:

* ensuring the request is made to the correct service or service instance
* authorizing access to APIs and resources
* providing an audit train of requests within a system
* providing context for other decisions made within a service

There are several methods defined to perform this authentication.  SOme of the most common include:

* TLS authentication of the server using X.509 certificates and bearer token JWTs within an HTTP or other protocol request.
* Mutual TLS authentication using X.509 certificate for both client and server
* TLS authentication of the server and HTTP request signing using a secret key

2. Additional Context Establishment

3. Asynchronos Requests

4. Scheduled Batch Requests
